        <h1 style="color: aqua;">ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p id="aboutme">
            Learning is dynamic. It is just like a seed that is being planted with a specific purpose with the assurance 
            that one day it will decay, wear a new body, spring off the soil and starts tending up, then it grows. 
            It's continuous existence as it grows gives it the opportunity to tap from the soil from where it sprang up 
            and eventaully matures to regenerate into Its kinds. The 'kinds' here symbolizes multiplicity of impacts and 
            coverage/expansion which ranges from financial to social values. As it pays to seed, so it is and will continue 
            to be; learning. I seek a new challenge and a ground that is ripen with learning however though it may seem. 
            Good life and growth are in the domain of measurable and defined challenges which come with a good cost. Meeting 
            new people of practical and social powerful stances is a desire always pruned. Working with cross-racial and 
            diversed-religious personality will help me build good thought about life and the people therein. I am a go-getter 
            and very jealous at what i do to earn a living. I don't compromise nor bend rules set out by my employer unless the 
            instance at which it creates/gives good financial shore-up for my company as that is the bedrock of its 
            existence/establishment while creating values for people. I am a Careful and accurate web-developer with mastery 
            on tech-invoguing models like HTML, CSS, SASS, Javascripts, Nodejs, JQuery, etc. I have built some web-based profiles and landing pages which
             make the eyes glue at an instance of perusal. I have excellent knowledge in the operations of computing packages 
             like Ms Words, Ms Excel AND Powerpoint. Few financial institutions around my sphers of contact have had my presence. 
             Three of these are: The United Bank For Africa(UBA PLC), XpatFunds Financial Services Aba and Mainstreet Bank. I was 
             given the opportune time to work as an IT and customer service personnel. This indeed had imparted on me super skills in good 
             networking and human relationship. I have some weakneses which are just limited to having zero tolerance to fraud, 
             attention to details, thrift with expences, zero tolerance to disproportionate lies. I have few strenght like working 
             with team, meeting deadlines, integrity, sportsmanship, ownership spirit, going the extra-miles and a go-getting spirit among many others.
